# MemoReader: Large-Scale Reading Comprehension through Neural Memory Controller
## Motivation

- As most of the human knowledge exists in a form of text, improvement in the performance of machine reading tasks would boost utilization of human knowledge.
- Current machine reading comprehension models have deficiency in properly understanding long documents(long term dependency problem).
- Need advances in dealing with large memories and information loss.

## Approaches

1. External Memory Controller
2. Expanded GRU Cell
